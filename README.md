# Carrara_Zinno_NPS
Repository containing the R scripts written for the project of the course of Nonparametric Statistics at Polimi

Here I provide a brief explanation of the content of the scripts:
- *Data_Preparation.R* : uploading the data, preparation of the data for the following analysis, visualization of the raw data
- *Auxiliary_Function.R* : contains useful functions written by us
- *Time_Series_Heatmap.R* : plotting the data using ggplot2 heatmaps
- *Exploration_and_Depth.R* : performing depth measure for preliminary analysis
- *Smoothing.R* : performing b-spline smoothing of data in order to get fd objects to feed to the Functional Linear Model
- *BetaMod_Tests.R* : performing permutation tests in order to assess reasearch questions about beta modulation
- *Linear_Functional_Model.R* : building a functional model to assess relationship between beta modulation and other covariates
